About The Project
<p align="left"> This project was created for <b>DigiKey</b>, one of the world’s leading electronic components distributors. The goal was to design an interactive 3D training environment that blends product visualization, warehouse simulation, and a learning journey through DigiKey’s ecosystem.
The experience allows users to navigate through a virtual DigiKey facility, interact with products in 3D, access technical details via CMS, and link directly to DigiKey’s website for datasheets and purchasing.
</p> <h3>Main Features</h3>
3D Model Visualization – Explore and rotate detailed product models in a virtual training setting.
CMS Integration – Dynamic product data connected with DigiKey’s content systems.
3D Interactions – Interactive hotspots and training touchpoints for user engagement.
2D Website Connection – Direct links to datasheets and product pages within DigiKey’s site.
Training Environment – Simulated warehouse and test benches replicating DigiKey’s operations.
<h3>Challenges</h3> <p> One of the main challenges of the DigiKey training environment was balancing technical accuracy with performance. The system needed to display multiple interactive 3D models while maintaining fast load times and responsive user interaction.
I worked on integrating CMS-driven data with the 3D space, ensuring smooth communication between the virtual environment and DigiKey’s product pages. Another challenge was creating intuitive interaction flows that would allow users to transition from immersive 3D experiences to technical product information seamlessly.
